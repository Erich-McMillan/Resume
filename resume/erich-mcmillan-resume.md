*Leading team of test + devops to automate existing manual firmware tests and infrastructure to run them*

 * Identify and assign test automation tasks to team members, and provide expertise and triage on issues discovered.
 * Conduct organisational workshops and training (for 100+ attendees) on in-house test framework built on Robot-Framework
 * Coordinate with devops team to design/deliver organizational test strategy for testing firmware components independendently
 * Designed ODM (offshore development/manufacture teams) development process to prevent malicious code from being introduced; collaborate with devops team to ensure implementation
 * Coordinated with Azure pipeline developers to implement build improvements bringing the build time from 30mins to 14mins.
 * Developing tools to determine code coverage using QEMU and Python

*Firmware developer for HP Commercial Laptops/Desktops focused on firmware security features.*

* 10 patents related to firmware security in filing, pending approval
* As part of a team of four developers, designed/developed and tested a critical SecureBoot and setting protection feature for government 3rd party reseller resulting in a $90 million win over Lenovo. Provided fourth level support for customer, including developing/testing Linux integration scripts.
* Co-chaired 'Better BIOS Coding' meeting with lead architect, which resulted in coding standards documents and re-evaluation of code practices
* Co-developed a Robot-Framework based UEFI automated integration testing framework capable of switching between phyiscal and virtual platform testing. Created pull-request pipeline to run 300+ automated tests in QEMU prior to code merge.
* Reviewed feature specifications, provided threat-modeling and coordinated with security architects to design mitigations and usability enhancements
* Coordinated with networking team to develop pre-boot Bitlocker via Wifi testing infrastructure for $40 million deal with large semi-conductor manufacturer.
* Co-developed a faster/easier alternative to Tianocore's UEFI unit testing framework, using Ceedling.
* Managed the security code bi-monthly code release tools and process.
* Assisted with design, documentation and rollout of migration from SVN to Git
